// For scripts, see *.pig in the same directory

Problem 1:

1.1 How many MapReduce jobs are generated by example.pig?
3

1.2 How many reduce tasks are within the first MapReduce job? How many reduce tasks are within later MapReduce jobs?
50 Reduce Tasks in Job #1
1 Reduce Task in Job #2
50 Reduce Tasks in Job #3

1.3 How long does each job take? How long does the entire script take?

Job #1 - 5 min 8 sec
Job #2 - 1 min 9 sec
Job #3 - 2 min 45 sec


Entire Script takes 9mins 53 secs.

1.4 What is the schema of the tuples after each of the following commands in example.pig?

After the command ntriples = ...
After the command objects = ...
After the command count_by_object = ...

ntriples = {subject: chararray,predicate: chararray,object: chararray}
objects = {group: chararray,ntriples: {(subject: chararray,predicate: chararray,object: chararray)}}
count_by_object = {group: chararray,count: long}
